        <h2>About us</h2>

        <p class="lead">
            Formed in 2006 London RIB Voyages™ was the first speedboat operator ever to set sail on the iconic river Thames, gaining our first award “Small Business of the Year” before the season was out. By 2007 we had been presented with the “Best New Tourist Attraction:Gold Award” from Visitlondon and been voted Five Stars ***** by Timeout, London.  Last year we proudly became the Number #1 ‘activity to do in London’ on Tripadvisor as a direct result of our valued passengers taking to the web to rave about their experience.  Most recently we were entered into the “Hall of Fame” after receiving our 5th consecutive “Certificate of Excellence” year on year – so you see, there really is no stopping us…
