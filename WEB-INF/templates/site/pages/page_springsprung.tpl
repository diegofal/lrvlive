            <h5>About the trip</h5>
            <p class="lead">For us that only means one thing. Sunshine, spring chickens, and the start of another Super Speedy Summer!</p>
            <p>Bounce down to the London Eye Pier this Easter for a real spring awakening! Hop on board our new fleet of ‘Rockets’ for an Easter hunt like no other. Seek out St Paul’s, eyes out for the London Eye and then share your spoils by the Shard!</p>
            <p>Our Rockets will spring you forward at 30 knots skipping around the docklands – jumping and hippity-hopping over the wake. You’ll feel reborn and newly hatched, with bespoke music pumping from the speakers as you hold on tight to those Easter bonnets and keep those chocolate eggs tucked up safe.</p>
            <p>As always our sweetly skilled guides are on hand to keep the banter flowing. They may even put some bunny ears on for you (if you ask nicely). Just don’t try to steal their eggs…</p>
            <p>We believe there’s more to Easter than chocolate. We believe Easter is chocolate and speedboats.</p>
            <p>We've got a hopping made deal for you too, a family of four can travel with us any time throughout April for just £99.00 (valid on our Ultimate London Adventure and subject to availability.)  Call our bookings team on 020 7928 8933 and tell them you're "hopping mad" to receive this eggciting offer.</p>
