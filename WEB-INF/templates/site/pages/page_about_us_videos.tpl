											  In a momentary flash of inspiration we had the idea of using Stand-Up comedians as our guides. Yes that’s right our Stand Up comedians provide a constant supply of high-brow comedy and sparkling banter to ensure you thoroughly enjoy your tour.<br /><br />
											  They are also closet history boffins and have endless historical facts, figures and stories on everything and everyone that’s ever been in London.<br /><br />
											  But do not fear, our Stand-Ups undergo rigorous vessel and safety training and complete regular emergency drill procedures. They are the ‘best of the best’ in their very particular niche category of ‘Stand-Up Comedian, High Speed, Thames Safety Crew and Guides’<br /><br />
											  Please feel free to e-mail them and thank them for your trip of or ridicule them for incorrect dating of a vital event. They really do appreciate any feed-back. It makes their day and beats heckling!
