		<p>London RIB Voyages regularly welcome film crews and photographers on to the river Thames. It's impossible to match the manoeuvrability of our RIB's, making us the perfect choice for a wide range of clients from a whole spectrum of backgrounds.</p>
 
		<p>Recent clients include Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Dispatches, Soccer AM, Top Gear, Jedward's Big Adventure and The Graham Norton Show (to name but a few!).</p>
 
		<p>Not only that, but London RIB Voyages have proved to be the most most rock n' roll fleet on the Thames! </p>
 
		<p>We also welcome guests on their way to the O2 including Ozzy Osbourne, Robert Redford, The Black Eyed Peas, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Eagles, Boris Johnson, Michael MacIntyre, Peter Kaye, Pink and many more.</p>
 
		<p>So let us take your crew out to get up close and personal to what you need to see, because only London RIB Voyages have the experience and know-how to get you what you need.</p>
