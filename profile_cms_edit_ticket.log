There were 3 lots of Tesco customers together, all booking 4 passengers on (see AD authorised sailing times above). 18:00 did not meet min so put pax on 17:00 with other members of their party. This pax called to try and relocate to 18:00 as well. I told her that was not possible. Not particularly happy. 06/04/13',
