Immerse yourself in the darkness as you take to the water and blow the cobwebs away with a 40 minute blast to the tombstones of the Thames Barrier and back. A spine tingling soundtrack will accompany your journey as you twist and turn through the murky waters of the Thames at a blood-curdling 30 knots! Of course, our impish guides will be on hand to keep the screams alive and the horror high…</p>
            <p>With the adrenaline pumping it’s then time to join one of the premier ‘Ripper Tour’ providers, London Walks, for a very special Jack the Ripper walking tour! Follow the legends trail through the East End of London and discover the sites of his historic crimes. Not for the faint hearted – London Walks thrive on bringing you the grisly truth!</p>
            <p>Don’t worry if it all gets too much – you’ll be dropped safe and sound at the Ten Bells for a stiff drink to calm your nerves…</p>
            <p>Limited availability for Halloween night only!! Book early to avoid disappointment.</p>
