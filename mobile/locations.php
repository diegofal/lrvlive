This is where you'll be whizzing out on your London RIB Voyage, and we think it's the perfect base.  443 feet tall and 394 feet in diameter, the London Eye is the most successful tourist attraction in the UK, with 30 million people riding the London Eye since March 2000.</p>
          <img src="content/locations/londoneye.jpg" alt="London Eye" />
          <p>Considering it began with a temporary 5-year planning permission, we think our neighbours have created an extraordinary bit of history! 32 pods represent the 32 boroughs that make up this city as a whole, each offering the awesome sight of London's famous skyline. The London Eye has become a centrepoint for New Years Eve celebrations and the firework displays as Big Ben chimes in the new year are unrivalled.</p>
          <p>Although a famous British landmark, the construction employed companies from all over Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Czech Republic, and there are now similar attractions all around the world – as far as Singapore – proving the universal appeal of this unique experience.</p>

            <p>A record breaker in its day, the Victoria Tower opposite Big Ben was the largest stone square tower in the world when the Victorians built it – another example of their incredible feats of engineering, many of which you will see from your unique view in your very own speedboat!</p>

            The quintessential British landmark – Big Ben has been telling London the time since 31st May 1859. That&#39;s because it is not the tower that is named Big Ben, it is the huge 13.5 tonne bell within.

            <p>If you&#39;re lucky enough to pass on the hour you will hear the Westminster Bells singing out Handel&#39;s ‘Messiah’ followed by the unmistakable first chime which is required to be correct to within one second.</p>
            <p>Look closely and you may notice the tower leans slightly. It&#39;s not an optical illusion! This was due to the construction of the Jubilee line that runs right below it knocking it off its foundations.</p>
            <p> Luckily, it still stands as sign of London’s resilience. After celebrating her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 the tower was renamed in the Queen&#39;s honour and is now officially known as the Elizabeth Tower. You cannot travel around London without hearing the famous bell within.</p>

            <img src="content/locations/somerset.jpg" alt="Somerset House" />
            <p>This area proved a very strategic home for ambitious nobles, being placed perfectly on the thoroughfare between the Tower of London and the Palace of Westminster. Unfortunately, the Duke had upset quite a few people with the demolition of churches and chapels to create his mansion and he was finally overthrown and beheaded for treason on Tower Hill in January 1552. Falling into the hands of the crown, Somerset House soon became a centre of royal social and artistic life.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I all enjoyed life at this Tudor Palace. Oliver Cromwell was laid in state here in 1658 and the Palace even escaped the clutches of the Great Fire of 1666, which stopped just short of the site. 100 years later and Somerset House was a shadow of its former glory. Falling into disrepair, George III ordered the demolition of the Palace and relocated the official dower house of the Queen to Buckingham House.</p>
            <p>The rebuilding of the House resulted in what you see today. The courtyard plays host to an ice rink in the winter and an outdoor cinema in the summer – keeping its original traditions of social and artistic life very much alive!</p>

He installed a set of square and triangular windows on each side. When the lights were switched on somehow they managed to spell out the name 'OXO'!</p>
            <p>When cornered, Albert Moore blamed coincidence and managed to get away with it, leaving the iconic tower proudly displaying the illegal advert. Get yourself a table in the restaurant bar one evening and enjoy a cocktail while watching the sunset over St Paul's Cathedral.</p>

                The ship that now sits here on the Thames as a bar and venue hire has had a very covert past! This was a Q-Ship during WWI. Impressively, it is one of the only three surviving warships built by the Royal Navy for that conflict.

            <p>Built specifically for anti-submarine warfare her successors evolved into today's frontline Frigates. As a Q-Ship it was an undercover ship. When submarine attacks on British merchant ships became a serious menace after 1916, the existing Flower-class minesweepers were transferred to convoy escort duty, and fitted with depth charges as well as 4.7-inch naval guns.</p>
            <p>They were designed to look like merchant ships, while carrying concealed 4-inch and 12-pounder naval guns. U boats would dive at the sight of a warship, so these undercover vessels posing as merchant ships could approach close enough to unveil its true identity! Today the ship plays host to weddings, birthdays and many other special occasions.</p>
            <p>It stands as a quiet reminder of the crafty side of naval warfare, which was so vital in the success of our famous maritime nation.</p>

Wren is today buried in the crypt he designed. Blink and you miss him though – a small square plaque on the floor. However it’s the crafty epitaph, "Reader, if you seek my monument, look around you" which gives Wren the last laugh!</p>

            <p>It crosses at a point that now links the Tate Modern to St Paul's Cathedral and the views are outstanding.</p>

            <p>Designed by Giles Gilbert Scott (the man responsible for designing London’s famous red telephone box!), the new designers (Herzog & de Meuron) wanted to retain the original character.

            <p>Today the replica offers a glimpse into life on an Elizabethan sea vessel. Open for tours and educational experiences, it is a far cry from today's power-driven boats.

Not the prettiest bridge in London (which is probably why many visitors confuse London Bridge with the much more opulent Tower Bridge), but certainly one of the most important.</p>
            <img src="content/locations/londonbridge.jpg" alt="London Bridge" />
            <p>The current bridge was completed fairly recently in 1973. However, surely the most spectacular bridge on this site was the medieval London Bridge. With shops, housing and even a chapel in the middle, the old London Bridge really was a town within a town! Built over a series of arches, the river below was forced through these creating severe river rapids. A popular (but hugely dangerous!) pastime was ‘shooting the bridge’ – only the brave or foolhardy attempted to steer their boats through on a flood tide, and many were drowned during the attempt. The bridge was "for wise men to pass over, and for fools to pass under."</p>
            <p>Today the modern London Bridge is a major pedestrian commuter route into the heart of the city. It is quite a sight at 5pm to see the city workers leaving and filling the bridge with suit after suit after suit. We certainly feel blessed when we cruise under during rush hour, sometimes modernising the old saying to ourselves, “the bridge is for wise men to pass under, and for fools to pass over!”</p>

            </p>
            <p>In September 1666 one of our most famous disasters struck changing the face of London forever. The King's baker, Thomas Farriner, left kindling alight as he retired for the night. It wasn't long before the wood and thatch building was on fire. An easterly breeze pushed the fire into the city and the rest is history! 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, the old St Paul's Cathedral and most of the buildings of the City authorities disappeared in a conflagration that lasted 4 days and 4 nights.</p>
            <p>The Monument now stands the same distance as it's height from the site on Pudding Lane where the bakers shop was and serves as a reminder of London's ability to rebuild itself. Still an observation deck today with the golden urn of flames at the top creating the impression of an everlasting candle – this is yet another contribution from Christopher Wren to the re-establishment of the London skyline.</p>
            <p>It is still today the tallest isolated stone column in the world and a real testament to the resilience of Londoners to use disaster as a springboard for achievement.</p>

            <p>The broken top creates the impression of a huge shard of glass rising up out of the capital. The tallest building in Western Europe towers at 1016ft from base to tip. It's on the 72nd floor on the Shard's observation deck you can enjoy views as far as the North Sea over 50 miles away!</p>
            <p>Filled with offices, leisure complexes, retail space, hotels and residences, the Shard is a vertical city in the middle of London. If you fancy one of the luxury apartments it'll set you back a mere £50million. And if you dare travel the 72 floors to the top deck don't forget to give us a wave.</p>

Famous workers include Michael Caine (then Maurice Micklewhite.) and the Kray twins! The beautiful arcaded market hall was built in 1875, but the market itself was moved to a new site on the Isle of Dogs in 1982. The building remains as one of London’s most beautiful landmarks with the best views from – you’ve guessed it – the river! It is now a listed building and used as a hospitality and events space.

It's 6th June 1944. 06.30 and as the sun rises one of the most important events of modern history is about to take place. It would become known as D-day. HMS Belfast was the largest ship in the British fleet and it's these guns, with a range of 12.5 miles, which started firing at Hitler's troops on that historic day.

            <p>During the five-week bombardment of German troops in Normandy, Belfast fired 1,996 rounds from her 6-inch guns. The name is of course from the capital city of Northern Ireland and the port it was built in was incidentally the same port as the Titanic! Thankfully its career has been much more successful than its peer and you can visit the museum ship at its permanent mooring here next to Tower Bridge.</p>
            <p>From our twelve-seater RIB seeing the ominous façade of the hull up close proves what an awesome and mighty warship this once was. You’ll notice it's much friendlier today so don’t forget to wave at the visitors as they enviously look down!</p>
            <p>With over 250,000 visitors per year HMS Belfast has proved to be a hugely popular glimpse into a small part of this nation's rich maritime history.</p>

                What's the most famous date in British history? 1066. The race for the English Crown after the death of the childless Edward the Confessor came to a head at the Battle of Hastings, where William the Conqueror became the last person to ever successfully invade Britain.

            <p>He needed to quickly stamp his authority on the Saxon town and he did it with this – a mighty palace and fortress that was to stand the test of time and become the most enduring and historic site in London.</p>
            <p>The Tower has survived every major disaster in London and been in some way related to nearly every major event over its 1000 year lifetime. With a lifetime to last a millennium it is inevitably going to be used for a huge range of needs. The Tower has been home to the royal treasury, the royal mint, London Zoo, an armoury and a place of execution and torture, to name but a few. You will see the entry to the traitors gate from our RIB where the accused were brought to be imprisoned and eventually executed</p>
            <p>Home of the Crown Jewels today and probably the most important thing you should do in London (apart from a London RIB Voyage of course!) the Tower continues to be a fascinating anchor to an event that was to shape the way we live to this day.</p>

            <p>Parliament, Tower Bridge and the embankment of the river is all their amazing work. The towers of the bridge were designed to be in keeping with the look of the Tower of London and for much of its life the bridge was painted brown! It was the silver jubilee of 1977 when we decided to update the colours to that of the British flag. The walkway at the top was originally for pedestrians. The cumbersome nature of climbing to the top and down again just to cross the river proved unpopular and were closed in 1910. In 1982, 2 years before it's 100th birthday, they were reopened as part of the Tower Bridge Experience giving visitors the chance to explore how and why the bridge was built and to experience the steam room that originally powered the opening of the bridge.</p>

            <p>On 21st May 2007, a fire tore through the ship leaving most of it damaged. It was discovered the cause of the fire was due to a cleaner leaving a hoover running! Huge restoration work ensued at a cost of £50million and the new Cutty Sark was unveiled in April 2012.</p>
            <p>Opened by the Queen – a familiar ceremony as the Queen opened the 19th century tea clipper exhibit in 1957. Unusually the name 'Cutty Sark' is Scottish slang for 'short undergarments'! If you look carefully you may see the figurehead.</p>
