             <p>London RIB Voyages launched Break the Barrier in the summer of 2013 and immediately changed the way we power-boat on the Thames. Operating exclusively in the ‘High Speed Zone’ this is the all-new speed experience which is just that – ALL SPEED!</p>
            <p>Boarding at St Katharine Pier in the shadow of the iconic Tower Bridge you set sail to a rousing “Best of British” soundtrack from iconic music to the unmistakable voices of Winston Churchill, Peggy Mitchell, Del Boy, Mayor of London Boris Johnson and many more.</p>
            <p>Before you know it, we let rip! Pushing speeds of up to 30 knots (35mph!) our 12 metre long aero-dynamically designed fiberglass ‘Thames Rocket’ will twist and turn its way east flashing past Canary Wharf, the Cutty Sark, Greenwich and the O2 arena. </p>
            <p>There’s a chance to catch your breath as we cruise through the marvel that is the Thames Barrier, before ‘Pulling G’ and firing up the 630hp engines to blast us home.</p>
            <p>Plenty more music and memories along the way, and with an expert Skipper and award winning guide on hand to keep you entertained this is a jam packed 40 minutes that’ll leave you wanting to turn round and do it all again!</p>
            <p>London RIB Voyages brings you ‘Break the Barrier’... Are you ready?</p>
