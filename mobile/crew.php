               I’m from Manchester and when not clog dancing or working in the local cotton mill I enjoy dining in the finest restaurants in London. I am still surprised that someone will employ me to hang out on a speedboat all day telling people about this amazing city! I’m not going to lie – my job is pretty cool.</p>

                <p>I am hoping to soon have the weathered face of an old sea-dog when I will change my name to Arthur and talk exclusively in vowels. That’s what ‘boaty’ people are like, isn’t it? Is anyone out there selling any parrots? I’d be interested…</p>

                <p>In fact, if you are very lucky, I may be conducting my tours as my alter ego: Pirate Geoff.</p>

            In a laboratory at the London Rib Voyages secret research facility an experiment was taking place, their goal was to create the ultimate river tour guide by genetically splicing the cuteness of a puppy, the swimming ability of a fish and the knowledge of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Unfortunately due to a slight mishap involving an LHC (Little Hadron Collider), a doughnut and a warm tea spoon, the subject was imbued with the cuteness of a fish, the knowledge of a puppy and the swimming ability of the Encyclopaedia Britannica - and Little Mike was created!!</p><p>
            I tried using my new found abilities to fight crime but I found it quite tiring so I went back to being a guide. I am fully house trained and enjoy being scratched behind the ears…

I am known for playing Dwayne Hoffman in BBC Wales sitcom High Hopes, Grant in the BBC Three show Grownups, and Owen in the BBC Wales drama series Belonging. I am also well known for playing the role of Owain Hughes in the third series of Gavin & Stacey.

         <p>Hi! I’m Amy and I love to show people the BEST that London has to offer – all from the comfort of our very own SPEEDBOAT! Always up for a laugh – the most important thing to me is that everyone has a great time, and leaves with an even bigger smile than me (if that is even possible! Which it isn’t, so don’t even try)!</p>
            <p>I have also been known to build theatrical sets, paint anything anyone asks me to and operate a 12 foot Disco Turtle through Brockwell Park wearing a green wig. Honestly – I never know what I’m doing one day to the next! </p>
            <p>What I do know is that if you are lucky enough to have me as your guide we will spend 50 minutes giggling our way through the capital on one of the coolest vehicles the Thames has ever seen. I may even wear my green wig…</p>

         <p>Hi I’m Tom, I’m from the green rolling fields of Gloucestershire where everyone is related. I moved to the big smoke to study at the Drama Centre London as an actor. When I’m not starring in James Bond films I like spending my time entertaining and having a laugh speeding around on the Thames! I think there’s nothing better than waking up in the morning at 4am, beefing up for 3 hours in the gym, and then spending the day pointing at London’s landmarks with my massive arms.</p>
            <p>On one of my trips you can expect high energy, a good laugh and maybe a selfie or two when I photograph you and your pals. Ask me anything you like – I guarantee to know everything you want about London. See you on-board for some speed, sights and serious fun!</p>

            <p>I’m an actor, a film producer and an opener of tight jars. You probably recognise me from the recent Marks and Spencer’s advert where I played a cheeky yet devilishly handsome bellboy. When I’m not creating a marketing impact for major retail stores, I like to spend my days messing about on boats. Not just any old boats – oh no! I’m talking 12.5 metre, aerodynamically designed, 615 horsepower ROCKETS! That is the way to see London people!</p>
            <p>I’m originally from Birmingham but please don’t hold that against me. If ‘Brummy Boy’ is doing your tour you’re sure to have an absolute blast! How do I know that? Because I will be!</p>
            <p>I’m pretty awesome. Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesclayactor">@jamesclayactor</a> if you don’t believe me.</p>

            <p>Hey guys and gals, Ginger Mike here and at your service. You want a speedboat ride? We can do that. You want a guided tour that actually interests you, dare I say even makes you laugh? Sure no problem. You want classic feel good tunes accompanying the #1 river trip in London? Easy peasy!</p>
            <p>We love being part of your day out in London. We love this city and we love watching you scream with joy as we open up the throttles and propel you down the Thames. It’s what we do.</p>
            <p>An actor, occasional rock guitar god and master of the one pot meal – I’ll pass on all the knowledge and skills you’ll need to succeed in this speedboat mission. If you make it I may even make you an honorary Ginger!</p>
