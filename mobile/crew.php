                I’m from Manchester and when not clog dancing or working in the local cotton mill I enjoy dining in the finest restaurants in London. I am still surprised that someone will employ me to hang out on a speedboat all day telling people about this amazing city!</p>
                <p>
                I am hoping to soon have the weathered face of an old sea-dog when I will change my name to Arthur and talk exclusively in vowels.

            In a laboratory at the London Rib Voyages secret research facility an experiment was taking place, their goal was to create the ultimate river tour guide by genetically splicing the cuteness of a puppy, the swimming ability of a fish and the knowledge of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Unfortunately due to a slight mishap involving an LHC (Little Hadron Collider), a doughnut and a warm tea spoon, the subject was imbued with the cuteness of a fish, the knowledge of a puppy and the swimming ability of the Encyclopaedia Britannica - and Little Mike was created!!</p><p>
            I tried using my new found abilities to fight crime but I found it quite tiring so I went back to being a guide. I am fully house trained and enjoy being scratched behind the ears…

        Hi I'm Tom, I'm from the green rolling fields of Gloucestershire where everyone is related. I moved to the big smoke to study at the Drama Centre London as an actor. When I'm not starring in James Bond films I like spending my time entertaining and having a laugh speeding around on the Thames!</p><p>
        On one of my trips you can expect high energy, a good laugh and maybe a selfie or two when I photograph you and your pals.  See you on-board for some speed, sights and serious fun!
