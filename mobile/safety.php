          <p class="lead">
              On all of our Thames river experiences we demonstrate a clear and unswerving commitment to safety – your safety and comfort are paramount.
          </p>

          <p>We are the largest speedboat operator of RIB voyages in the UK and being the original provider of such experiences have set the industry standard others are now expected to follow.</p>
          <p>Should you require copies of our Insurance, we will be happy to e-mail this to you in advance of your booking. If you require risk assessments or Domestic Safety Management Codes then these are available to view, upon written request.
              <br><br>
              We work closely with the Maritime Accident Investigation Bureau to bring in new safety codes, modes of operation and analyse how the industry can be safely improved to achieve a balance between commercial considerations and reducing risk as low as reasonably practical.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately this experience is not suitable for expectant mothers at any stage during their pregnancy.</p>
          <p>Our experiences are also not recommended for anybody with a past or current back, neck or heart condition due to the unpredictable nature of the Thames.  Please understand we are not medical experts and cannot offer guidance on individual cases, our automatic advice would be if you have concerns please do not participate for your own comfort and welfare. </p>

        <li>
          <h4>London Eye and St Katharine Pier</h4>
          <p class="lead">London RIB Voyages comply with the very strict code of conduct, operating procedures and risk assessments required by the two most prestigious piers on the river; The London Eye Millennium Pier and St Katharine Pier.</p>
                    <p>Both locations have equally first-class expectations, rules and guidelines all operators using their services must follow without exception. </p>
                    <p>The Coca Cola London Eye is owned and operated by Merlin Entertainments.  The pier itself was one of five new piers opened in 2000 on the Thames funded by the Millennium Commission as part of the Thames 2000 project.  Today it services commuter and work boats as well as sightseeing operators such as ours.  Their security team and pier managers are second to none and work closely with our team to ensure 100% customer safety and comfort.</p>
                    <p>St Katharine Pier sits just in front of St Katharine Dock, tucked neatly under Tower Bridge.  The area is one of London’s best kept secrets, a beautiful marina with shops, bars and restaurants in contrast to the chaos of their neighboring attraction The Tower of London.  The pier has a full and dedicated security team demanding optimum commitment to safety and maximum customer care at all times, footfall is kept to a minimal to ensure the very best passenger experience.</p>

        <li>
          <h4>Sailing Jackets</h4>
          <p>It’s better to be too hot than too cold! Due to an element of wind-chill in certain conditions on this type of vessel we recommend you wear the jackets we supply over your own jumper or jacket. They are super warm, super stylish and we supply to fit all ages.</p>

          <h4>Sailing Trousers</h4>
          <p>Waterproof sailing trousers can be worn over the top of your clothes to protect your legs. These are always available but rarely necessary, we have all shapes and sizes to fit our passengers.</p>

          <h4>Goggles</h4>
          <p>If it clouds over and begins to rain, we provide goggles on-board to protect your eyes and so even during our super-fast speedy section you can see everything in comfort. We like to think they complete the London RIB Voyages ensemble.</p>

          <h4>Baby Cradle</h4>
          <p>We are a family sightseeing company so babies are more than welcome. We supply baby life cradles, which completely surround the babies clothing and are very manageable for mum to have on her lap. These are of course fitted by our experienced staff.</p>
