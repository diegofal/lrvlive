            <p class="lead">Celebrate this year’s ‘Totally Thames Festival’ on a river trip with a modern twist!</p>
            <p>London RIB Voyages are a proud partner of ‘Totally Thames’, where you can learn all about the greatest river in the world through an exciting season of arts, cultural and river events throughout the 42-mile stretch of the Thames in London.</p>
            <p>We bring the old into the new as you step aboard our super-shiny ‘Rockets’ at St Katharine Pier in the shadow of the iconic Tower Bridge. Say goodbye to the past as you zip ahead of the big tourist boats and feel the wind in your hair as we rev up our 615 horsepower engines!</p>
            <p>For 15 minutes we’ll show you how far we’ve come in 2000 years, with music pumping from the speakers we’ll twist and turn at speeds of 30 knots – that’s 35mph!</p>
            <p>Come and enjoy the most famous river in the world, 21st century style.</p>
