           <h5>About the trip</h5>
            <p class="lead">This is the one that started it all! Our ‘Ultimate London Adventure’ is a jam-packed, fun-filled adrenaline-fuelled 50 minutes that will leave you wanting to go again and again.</p>
            <p>Step aboard our new generation of speedboats NEW for 2015 - ‘Thames Rockets’. Don’t forget to hold on tight as you fly through the world’s most famous capital city marveling at the sights and sounds that have shaped London’s awesome 2000 year history.</p>
            <p>Our hand picked award winning guides are on hand to keep the banter flowing. Not only are they stand up comedians by night – they’re also closet history buffs and love nothing more than to share their knowledge of the weird and wonderful world of the Thames. Even Londoners will learn something new!</p>
            <p>Then it’s time to ‘pull g’ as the Thames is eaten up by combined 630hp engines and we open up the throttles to an exhilarating 30 knots through Canary Wharf. A medley of classic feel-good tunes accompanies your action fuelled speed experience and there’s no holding back as we leave other tour boats bobbing behind in your wake.</p>
            <p>Departing hourly from the London Eye, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Suitable for young and old alike and great fun whatever the weather, with wet weather kit provided for all ages and sizes.</p>
            <p>It’s the original and the best. No one does it like London RIB Voyages.</p>
