              <h2>Baby Cradle</h2>
              <p>We are a family sightseeing company so babies are more than welcome. We supply baby life cradles, which completely surround the babies clothing and are very manageable for mum to have on her lap. These are of course fitted by our experienced staff.</p>
              
                <h2>Sailing Jackets</h2>
              <p>It’s better to be too hot than too cold! Due to an element of wind-chill in certain conditions on this type of vessel we recommend you wear the jackets we supply over your own jumper or jacket. They are super warm. They are super stylish and we have them to fit all ages.</p>

                <h2>Sailing Trousers</h2>
              <p>We also supply sailing trousers to be worn over the top of your trousers. These are always available but rarely necessary. Again we have them for all shapes and sizes.</p>

                <h2>Goggles</h2>
              <p>If it clouds over and begins to rain, we provide goggles on-board so even during our super-fast speedy section you can see everything in comfort. We like to think they complete the London RIB Voyages ensemble!</p>
